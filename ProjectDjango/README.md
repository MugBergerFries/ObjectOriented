## Project Overview:

TidyTunes is an application that allows Spotify users to clean up their playlists. It accomplishes this by finding songs in a playlist that do not compare to the general average song type of that playlist. We are able to do this using the Spotify API, which provides very in-depth analysis of songs. 

## Description of Files:

- ProjectDjango folder: contains files that deal with settings for our project as a whole
- authenticate: Our authenticate Django application. Here you will find all standard .py files that come with a Django application. Inside of views.py is where all of our code and logic is located. 
- frontend: Deprecated files that are no longer in use
- prune: Our prune Django application. Again, you will find all standard .py files that come with a Django application, but all of our work is done inside of views.py
- templates: Where all of our html templates are stored for our site 
- variousFiles: Where we store all of our non-code deliverables for this project (i.e class diagrams, reports, etc.) 
-runserver: The command to run our server (however, our server should be constantly running at this point). 

## How to execute our application:

No installation is needed to utilize our application. Simply navigate to www.tidytunes.org
